## Background

In this project I wrote code that dynamically creates a table on a web page according to a users input search data.  There's a search bar where users can input a date to see a UFO has been sighted on that particular date.

## Step by Step

* Used a UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and wrote code that appends a table to the web page and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
